=== Regarding Mods ===

We tried to make modding the game as easy as possible. Take a look at the .rpy files in the episodes folder and follow the same format for creating your own custom scenes: they'll be added to the episode select at the start.

That said, please don't be a jerk about it, y'know? All the in-game art (sprites/background/effects) and code was created by minute, and the Halloween 2018 special features a lot of art from other artists. These assets are for use within ITYS and any mods only - You can not put them into other projects.

If you'd like us to make more moddable content, be polite with these assets but also, please let us know if this is something that interests you!

=== Creating A Custom Scene ===

In the game/episodes/ folder, create a new folder and name it.
Create an .rpy file. On the top of the file, you'll create the episode container. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - 

init -1 python:
    episodes.append(Episode("YOUR EPISODE TITLE","LABELTOJUMPTO","PATH TO YOUR ICON.PNG FILE"))

- - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Example:
init -10 python:
    episodes.append(Episode("Stay Spooky, Maddie!","stayspooky","episodes/stayspooky/icon.png"))

label stayspooky:
## script continues here
- - - - - - - - - - - - - 

The number after the init determines where in the episode order your episode will be created. I recommend setting it to -1, so it'll come after all the canon content.

=== Adding Custom Images and Sounds ===

To reduce file roaming, I recommend putting custom images inside your episodes folder and declaring them in the script. IE:

- - - - - - - - - - - - - 
image custom_image = "episodes/your episode path/image.png"
define audio.your_song = "episodes/your episode path/song.ogg"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - 

However, you can also add images to the game/images/ folder and have them be automatically declared. When your mod is ready for release, it'll be your responsibility to zip everything together in a sensible way.

=== Other options ===

For advanced Ren'Py users, you can package your mod into an .rpa and distribute it that way. It'll be easier to install than a zip, and you'll be able to organize your files however you like. Keep in mind you'll likely have to script your episode in a separate Ren'Py project though!
