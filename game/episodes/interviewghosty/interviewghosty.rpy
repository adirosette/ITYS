tara "Ain't that the truth! Long-time listeners will be well aware of my many escapades into the forgotten cemeteries of Salem in search of a ghost… "

tara "I'm proud to announce every single trip was ONE-HUNDRED percent worth it!"

tara "Every show has its skeptics. Every believer has ten non-believers behind them. But today, I can finally say… "

taramorgan "I TOLD YOU SO!"

tara "Come on out, Abigail Dalsing!"

abby "Hello, hello!"

tara "So good to see you, Abby!"

abby "And you too, Tara! I can't believe it has been a full day since we last spoke."

morgan "Time really flies."

tara "Let's get this show on the road! So, Abs, can you introduce yourself to our audience?"

abby "...?"

tara "Abby?"

abby "Where is the audience? Shouldn't I speak to them?"

tara "Oh, man, Maddie, I thought you told me she was ready!"

# Maddie peeking in

maddie "She is! I… Sweetheart, the audience isn't here. We're {i}streaming{/i}, remember?"

abby "Oh! Right!"

# Abigail gets super close to the screen

abby "Hello, audience, my name is Abigail Dalsing. I died two hundred years ago, and-"

abby "Or, wait, maybe it was longer ago? Regardless, I'm better now!"

maddie "{i}Sweetie, back up from the camera.{/i}"

tara "Wow! Two hundred years… What did you do all that time?"

abby "Well… I mostly just walked around a lot. I sang to the animals, spoke to the fairies— "

tara "Abby wait that's another episode!"

abby "Oh, sorry! Let's see… I also spent a lot of time with my friend, the forest spirit— "

tara "That's also gonna be another episode! Don't worry folks, we'll fill you all in with due time!"

abby "All of my activities were quite magical now that I think about it."

tara "What do you think is society's biggest misconceptions about ghosts?"

abby "Oh, absolutely how scary they are! Ghosts in stories and films terrify me!"

abby "But cuddling with Madison while we watch horror films isn't so bad… So maybe it's a good thing!"

tara "Gay."

tara "Our viewers demand proof for everything. That's why I put my life on the line {b}DAILY{/b} to bring them the content they deserve."

tara "We asked you to bring a souvenir from your time as a ghost. What do you got for us?"

abby "I couldn't think of much, so instead, I thought I could demonstrate. A skill only a former ghost could perform."

tara "Woah! A real former-ghost demonstration!"

abby "Ah-hem-hem."

abby "..."

abby "... …. ……. … "

abby "... …. ………… Boo!"
tara "..."
morgan "... ..."

morgan "... Ahhhh...?"

tara "!!!! AHHHHHH!!!"

abby "It was merely a joke, Tara! Please don't get scared!"

abby "... That was pretty good though, wasn't it?"

tara "Absolutely! See right there, folks? Pure, unfiltered, fool-proof evidence!"

tara "Before we go, what's one thing you'd like to tell all the other ghosts out there?"

abby "Hm… Don't lose hope! You'll find your very own someone someday soon."

abby "Love is the greatest magic! You'll find a way to be together!"

abby "Also, learn how to turn book pages if you haven't yet… Then try to find something called {i}manga{/i}, they're so much more fun than stuffy old 1800's texts."

abby "Oh! And try floating on a plane! I never got the chance, but I bet it's really fun!"

abby "And don't forget to brush your teeth!"

abby "And-"

morgan "I think she's gonna keep going."

tara "Probably."

morgan "Well, that's all for this episode."

tara "I'm Tara!"

morgan "I'm Morgan."

Taramorgan "And we told you so."

# Minor cut to black, comes back with overlay like STREAM ENDED

tara "You did awesome, Abby!"

morgan "Great job."

maddie "Seriously, sweetheart, you were amazing."

abby "Aww, thank you girls… I couldn't do it without you!"

tara "Also, NICE outfit. Really nails the spooky ghost aesthetic."

abby "I'm having so much fun trying on new outfits! I also bought one to show to Madison— "

maddie "That we don't need to tell them about!"

abby "I'm just teasing you, darling! Haha, don't worry."

morgan "Anyone hungry? I'm going to order a pizza."

tara "With pineapples?"

morgan "Of course babe."

maddie "Sure, we can stay for a bit. We've got time."
